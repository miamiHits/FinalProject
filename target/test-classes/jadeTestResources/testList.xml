        <WhatTest> Test that non of the agents starts an iteration before the data collector sent them the end of iteration message.</WhatTest>
        <HowWorkTest>the test will simulate an agent and the data collector,
            the data collector and the test home agent will not send their messages immediately
            the test home agent will monitor messages received by its neighbours</HowWorkTest>
        <WhenTestPass>the test home agent did not receive a message from its neighbours until the data collector sent the end of iteration message</WhenTestPass>

    <Test name="Test Agent Receiving Messages From Data Collector" skip="false">
        <TestClassName>FinalProject.Experiment.TestAgentReceivingMessagesFromDataCollector</TestClassName>
        <WhatTest>verify that the data collector sends its messages</WhatTest>
        <HowWorkTest>
            the test will simulate an agent taking its part in an algorithm run, waiting for the message from the data collector with 10 seconds timeout.
            the main goal of the test is to find possible deadlock scenarios in the system and should be applied a significant amount of times for it to be effective
        </HowWorkTest>
        <WhenTestPass>during the whole simulated experiment in the test, the test home agent received the required messages from the data collector</WhenTestPass>
    </Test>
