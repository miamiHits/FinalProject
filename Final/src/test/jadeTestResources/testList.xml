        <WhatTest> Test that non of the agents starts an iteration before the other agents.</WhatTest>
        <HowWorkTest>messages received by the data collector are monitored,
            once all agents sent their end of iteration message the test behaviour send a fake C_sum and waits for the next iteration messages</HowWorkTest>
        <WhenTestPass> The test passes if the experiment ended and all of the messages were of the correct iteration</WhenTestPass>

        <WhatTest> Test that non of the agents starts an iteration before the data collector sent them the end of iteration message.</WhatTest>
        <HowWorkTest>the test will simulate an agent and the data collector,
            the data collector and the test home agent will not send their messages immediately
            the test home agent will monitor messages received by its neighbours</HowWorkTest>
        <WhenTestPass>the test home agent did not receive a message from its neighbours until the data collector sent the end of iteration message</WhenTestPass>
