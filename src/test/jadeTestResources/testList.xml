            Test that non of the agents starts an iteration before all of its neighbours has sent the iteration data message.

        <HowWorkTest>
            three of the agents in the simulation will used as test agents and will delay sending end of iteration message to their neighbours
            test agent 1 will delay message of iteration # devided by 2
            test agent 2 will delay message of iteration # devided by 3
            test agent 3 will delay message of iteration # devided by 5
            the data collector and the three test agents will verify that all start the next iteration once the previous one completed
        </HowWorkTest>
        <WhenTestPass>
            The experiment ended and all of the messages were of the correct iteration
            No agent started the next iteration before receiving end of iteration from all of it's neighbours

        <HowWorkTest>the test will simulate an agent and the data collector,
            the data collector and the test home agent will not send their messages immediately
            the test home agent will monitor messages received by its neighbours</HowWorkTest>

        <HowWorkTest>
            the test will simulate an agent taking its part in an algorithm run, waiting for the message from the data collector with 10 seconds timeout.
            the main goal of the test is to find possible deadlock scenarios in the system and should be applied a significant amount of times for it to be effective
        </HowWorkTest>
        <WhenTestPass>during the whole simulated experiment in the test, the test home agent received the required messages from the data collector</WhenTestPass>
